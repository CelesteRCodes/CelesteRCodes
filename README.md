
* Hi, guys! I'm an ICU RN of 5 years, who recently found out that I'm in love with computer programming. After facing burnout from working 12 hr shifts on the floors during these trying times, I finally decided to make a career change. 
* I'm grateful for the Hackbright company sponsored bootcamp that is currently making my new dreams for myself a reality. 
* "Learn something new everyday," is one of my favorite mantras. I also love "rubber-ducking" or "thinking outloud".. it's an innate talent 
(so yes, my pseudo-coding is on point!) ðŸ˜‰
