Hi, I'm Celeste! An ex-ICU RN of 5 years, who recently found out that I'm in love with computer programming. <br><br>
After facing burnout from working 12 hr shifts on the floors during these trying times, I finally decided to make a career change. <br><br>
I'm grateful for the Hackbright company sponsored bootcamp that is currently making my new dreams for myself a reality. <br><br>
"Learn something new everyday," is one of my favorite mantras. <br><br>
I also love "rubber-ducking" or "thinking outloud".. it's an innate talent (so yes, my pseudo-coding is on point!) ðŸ˜‰ <br><br>
So far, I'm loving HTML, CSS and JavaScript... I'm trying to like Python a bit more by practicing often. 
<br><br>
Interests: reading, tarot, astrology, gaming (The Sims), gardening, random arts and crafts, cooking/baking, kayaking, and just learning new skills
